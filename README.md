pyqa -- Configuration generator
===============================

pyqa makes it easier to write terminal based tools which ask the user a bunch of questions and then generate some configuration file based on the answers.

Usage
-----

See /demo for a working example.

pyqa provides single function, "ask". It expects a set of questions given in a specific format. The following description is in YAML but you are free to use any other markup language as long as the output matches:

```yaml
---
id: project_name # id to use at the template
q: Could you please give the project name? # question shown to the user
---
id: license
q: Please pick a license for your project?
choices: # if choices field is used, the user will see these as numbered choice
    - BSD
    - GPL
    - Other
matches:
    Other: Please enter the license name -- define custom question for "other" case
---
id: use_fizzler
q: Are you sure you want to use fizzler?
type: boolean -- this will accept either true or false answer and emits True/False
```

After the user has finished answering "ask" will return the results in a format like this:

```python
{'project_name': 'myproject', 'license': 'BSD', 'use_fizzler': True}
```

This format happens to be compatible with [pystache](https://github.com/defunkt/pystache) (Python version of [mustache](http://mustache.github.com/)) and no doubt with many other template engines. Just pass that data to your favorite engine, render and output the file somewhere. Voil√°!
